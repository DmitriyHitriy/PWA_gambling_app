This is a simple application that simulates a PWA application installed from a lying Google store. The user clicks on the link and sees an exact copy of Google play. The user clicks install, and the PWA application is installed in his phone. An application icon appears on the user's desktop, opening which he gets to the page of the desired offer.

The links to which the user should get after installation are registered in the offer.json file.

This application is installed on a VPS via nginx. Find information on the Internet.

In order for the user to install applications, an SSL certificate is required.
